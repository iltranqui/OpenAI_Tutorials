| Fit          | Exaplination | Formula|
|--------------|:-----:|-----------:|
| FitPercent |  FitPercent varies between -Inf (bad fit) to 100 (perfect fit). If the value is equal to zero, then the model is no better at fitting the measured data than a straight line equal to the mean of the data. |  |
| LossFcn | alue of the loss function when the estimation completes. It contains effects of error thresholds, output weight, and regularization used for estimation. | |
| AIC | A raw measure of Akaike's Information Criterion, defined as:| |
| AICc | 	 Small sample-size corrected Akaike's Information Criterion, defined as: | | 
| nAICc |  Normalized measure of Akaike's Information Criterion, defined as: | |
| BIC | Bayesian Information Criterion, defined as | |
