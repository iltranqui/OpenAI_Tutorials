1. T - Trend   ( Time Variant )
2. J - Jump    ( Time Variant )
3. P - Period  ( Time Variant )

- Jumps: Edivend short term changes in the dataset, whcih can be determine if significant by tests. 
- Period: Appear in series due to regular and oscillating changes with relatively constant time distances. 

Time Series are composed by Filling Missing Data
